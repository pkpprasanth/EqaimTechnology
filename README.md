# Step Addition Application

This is a Step Addition application that allows users to add two numbers and generate step-by-step addition process. The application consists of a frontend built with Next.js, a backend built with Node.js and Express, and a PostgreSQL database for storing the saved results.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Language: TypeScript

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- PostgreSQL database installed and running

## Usage

# Start the backend server:
node app.js
The server will run on http://localhost:3001.

# Start the frontend development server:

npm run dev
The frontend will be accessible on http://localhost:3000.
